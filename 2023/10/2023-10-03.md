# Ophyd-Async

## Goals

* Support old-style and new-style Devices within the same process---e.g. mixing old-style and new-style detectors and motors within the same Bluesky plan execution
* Use asyncio in core, rather than using threads
* Helpers for flyscanning
* Separate logic that defines the Bluesky verbs from the code that you write when you connect to a group of PVs

## Process

* Spoke to a lot of people
* Began writing code
* Planned out a lengthy adoption plan

Proposed Decision: Pivot from developing this new-style code within the `ophyd` repo to developing it in a new repo, `ophyd-async`. This enables them to be versioned at released at separate rates. It also communicates that old-style ophyd will continue to be supported.

## Considerations

* We need a nice synchronous CLI to support existing users, especially at LCLS.
  There are many ways this could be done in principle.
  * Service on a background thread, with a synchronous client, a la ASGI TestClient?
  * Modal option, long proposed for RE
  * Auto-autoawait
  * Context detection
  We will not commit to a choice yet, but we agree on the importance of eventually
  picking one to avoid splitting the ecosystem.
