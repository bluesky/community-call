## Notes from Talk

- https://github.com/spc-group/haven
- Factory function constructs RE with databroker, suspenders, etc.
- Beamline/branch has a TOML-based config file
    - An easy transition from INI, which is familiar to the staff
- `load_instrument()`
- Register device instances
- Look them up by name for access in plans
- Setting hints via queueserver
- PyDM widgets in a shared QApp
- PyDM plugin that defines a `oph://...` scheme that gets the PV out of ophyd, based on its name, and passes the PV down toe `ca://...`
- Firefly communicates with queuserver via the 0MQ interface
- Documents flow through Kafka to MongoDB
- Firefly will collect documents as they come for a live display
- Reflections
    - Pros
        - Adding devices, plans is fast
        - Searchable metadata is great, saves time
        - Clients can be fragile while qs is robust
        - Simualted devices (with caproto) are slow but great for testing
    - Cons
        - Async is correct but tricky
        - Getting people used to using a database
        - Curating metadata
